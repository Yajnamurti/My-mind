## Independent

When Krishna went to Mathura and to the wrestling arena, He created different impressions in the mind of those who were there:

“To the mass of people at the wrestling arena He appeared as the most beautiful personality, but to the wrestlers He appeared like a thunderbolt. The ksatriyas (warriors) saw Him as the strongest ruler, while the females saw Him as the most attractive male. The cowherd men from Vrndavana saw Him as their own kinsman, while the yogis saw Him as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart. Kamsa also saw Krishna uniquely—as Death Personified.”

In the same way people in general and devotees see us in different ways, for example some devotees see me as a good father, others as a strict devotee, others not, others say that I became an Indian person, etc...and I know that some think that I am an independent devotee. Well I don’t feel that I am independent as for example my body is getting old and I can not avoid it. My teeth are falling and my digestion is getting weaker and I am not independent to change it. I am affected by the environment where I live and I can not independently become not affected by fools and rascals. In the core of my heart I am completely dependent of Krisna's mercy and the mercy of true devotees.
I can not throw in the garbage the intelligence that Krishna has give me and if I perceive that a person is not sincere in his dealings with me I avoid him/her. I can not tolerate fake feelings  and acts done only because it's the etiquette.
And it's "funny" that some people and devotees whose life are a complete mess try to approach me to give advice. Anyway I must concentrate on my spiritual path and try to help those who I am able to help and continue to depending on Krishna's mercy and the devotees mercy.

“In the material world, to be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune, but in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most fortunate case when we can live completely dependent on Him. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything. But the cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material advancement of experimental knowledge. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt of becoming independent of the laws of nature. Beginning from Rāvaṇa, who wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the planets of heaven, down to the present age, they are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power.“
(Srimad Bhagavatam 1.8.37 purport)
