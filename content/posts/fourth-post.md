What right do we have to accept service from others? But in spite of that we think, “Let the whole universe serve me” and “I use the river water and fruit from the tree, but have no connection with the Lord.” If one wants to know about the Lord he must approach a devotee of the Lord. One cannot bypass the proper channel.
Ordinary persons and kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs cannot comprehend who is serving the Lord and who is not. Rather, they have the inclination to oppose those who serve the Lord because the service attitude and behavior of a devotee does not mix well with worldly so-called moral or immoral conduct. Materialists disparage devotees of the Lord, understanding that they are not instruments for the materialists’ satisfaction and pleasure.

Gauḍīya 15.253–57. ( Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Vaibhava
Book by HH Bhakti vikasa swami)
